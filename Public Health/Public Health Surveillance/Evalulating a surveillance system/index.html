<h1 id="evaluating-a-surveillance-system">Evaluating a surveillance system</h1>
<p>Every surveillance system should be evaluated periodically to ensure that it is serving a useful public health function and is meeting its objectives. A thorough evaluation should identify ways to improve the system’s operation and efficiency. In a thorough evaluation, the following facets of the system should be addressed (<a href="https://canvas.newcastle.edu.au/courses/19953/pages/2-evaluation-of-a-surveillance-system?module_item_id=896260#_bookmark7">1</a>).</p>
<p>A <strong>description</strong> of the surveillance system should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The public health importance of the health event under surveillance</li>
<li>The objectives and operation of the system</li>
<li>The costs or resource requirements for system operation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> of surveillance performance should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system’s usefulness</li>
<li>Attributes or qualities of the surveillance system, including:<ul>
<li>simplicity</li>
<li>flexibility</li>
<li>data quality</li>
<li>acceptability</li>
<li>sensitivity</li>
<li>predictive value positive</li>
<li>representativeness</li>
<li>timeliness</li>
<li>stability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these facets is described in the following pages.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="importance-of-a-surveillance-system">Importance of a surveillance system</h2>
<p>The importance of a health event and the need to have that health event under surveillance can be assessed with one or more of the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>total number of cases: incidence, prevalence</li>
<li>severity of illness: case-fatality rate, death-to-case ratio</li>
<li>mortality: overall and age-specific mortality rates, years of potential life lost</li>
<li>morbidity: hospitalisation, disability</li>
<li>health care costs</li>
<li>potential for spread or potential clinical course in the absence of intervention</li>
<li>preventability</li>
<li>public interest</li>
</ul>
<p>By considering the ‘potential for spread’, we recognise the need to maintain surveillance for diseases that currently may be rare or under control, but that could recur. By considering ‘preventability’, we reflect the intended link between surveillance and public health intervention.</p>
<p>Question
1. Incidence vs prevalence
2. Potential for spread - measles
3. Preventability - COVID? </p>
<hr/>
<p>Reading the points that discuss disease importance on the previous page raises two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is the importance of a disease always the same?</p>
<ul>
<li>Media, Political, Social</li>
<li>Importance not necessarily same as greatest burden (e.g. CVD, respiratory) - importance </li>
<li>ABS/AIHW publications can change level of importance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How and Why might it change?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutation of the pathogen: While generally over the long-term pathogens evolve to be less damaging to the host, over the short-term they can mutate to have worse symptoms, be more infectiousness, or evade immunity produced by vaccines or previous infection. When this happens it may increase the importance of the disease.</li>
<li>Public attitude: Funding is of course necessary to maintain surveillance programs, and this funding usually comes from the government, which can be influenced by the public opinion towards the necessity of the program. One example is the changing public attitude to the COVID-19 pandemic - while recently both case numbers and deaths in NSW have been increasing, the public have been less supportive of continued measures to control the spread and thus authorities have not re-introduced restrictions or changed plans for closures of testing clinics in the coming months.</li>
<li>Improvements in technology: Advancements in treatment may mean that the illness no longer has a serious impact on infected individuals and so is less important in terms of control. Reduction of prevalence or eradication due to vaccination programs may also decrease importance.</li>
<li>Changing conditions: Changes in weather and climate may influence disease spread, e.g. an increase in rainfall and/or humidity may increase the prevalence of fungal infections. Furthermore, changes in living conditions can significantly impact disease - improved sanitation, reduction of overcrowding, improvements in insulation etc. can all reduce the incidence of various diseases.</li>
<li>Context/people involved - e.g. HFMD in farmers (livestock yield, financial) vs an adult in Sydney</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Record your answer in the discussion below to these questions, and please comment on your colleagues answers as well.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="objectives-and-operations">Objectives and Operations</h2>
<p>The objectives of a surveillance system should be clear to those who maintain and who contribute to the system. It may be helpful to consider first what information is needed for effective prevention and control, then to determine which objectives are most appropriate. Objectives may include any of the uses of surveillance described earlier (see Module 1). For example, one of the objectives of a surveillance system may be to determine the occurrence of a health event or to monitor a program’s progress in eradicating a disease.</p>
<p>Using the link below, review the surveillance objectives (sometimes recorded as “reasons for surveillance”) in NSW Control Guidelines for some of the notifiable infectious diseases in New South Wales. Contrast, for example, the objectives for measles surveillance with those for chlamydia.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/controlguideline/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/controlguideline/Pages/default.aspx (Links to an external site.)</a></p>
<p>What questions might you raise to characterise the operations of a surveillance system? Think about the things that need to be included and read the examples on the next page.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="what-operations-do-we-need">What operations do we need?</h2>
<p>To characterise the operations of a surveillance system, we might consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the objective of the surveillance system?</li>
<li>What are the planned uses of the data from the system?</li>
<li>What is the case definition of the health event? Is it practical in this setting?</li>
<li>What is the legal authority for the data collection?</li>
<li>What is the level of integration with other systems?</li>
<li>What are the key components of the system?</li>
<li>What is the population under surveillance?</li>
<li>What is the time period of data collection (weekly, monthly, annually)?</li>
<li>What information is collected? Is it what programs need?</li>
<li>What are the reporting sources or data sources? Who is supposed to report? Who actually does report?</li>
<li>How is the data handled? How are they routed, transferred, stored? Are there unnecessary delays?</li>
<li>How is the data analysed? By whom? How often? How thoroughly?</li>
<li>How is the information disseminated? How often are reports distributed? To whom?</li>
<li>Does it get to all those who need to know, including the medical and public health communities and policymakers?</li>
<li>What measures are in place to ensure patient privacy, data confidentiality and system security?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to sketch a flow chart of a surveillance system to portray the flow of information visually. See the figure below. This can help to understand the flow of information, identify any potential problems with timely reporting, and help to understand who the information is important for from a public health perspective.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../../images/Pasted%20image%2020220822121953.png"/></p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="resource-requirements">Resource Requirements</h2>
<p>The direct costs of a surveillance system include the personnel and financial resources expended to maintain all phases of the system, including collection, analysis, and dissemination. We usually assess these direct costs against the system’s objectives and usefulness, and against the expected costs of possible modifications or alternatives to the system. Indirect costs should also be taken into account – these are the costs that result from onward changes due to the implementation of a surveillance system – such as the need for repeat laboratory tests or time off work for a person having a test again.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="usefulness">Usefulness</h2>
<p>Under usefulness, we address whether a surveillance system makes a difference. We may assess usefulness by answering the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>what actions have been taken to date (public health, clinical, legislative, etc.) as a result of information from the surveillance system?</li>
<li>who has used the information to make decisions and take actions?</li>
<li>what other future uses might the information have?</li>
</ul>
<p>The usefulness of a system is influenced greatly by its operation, including: its feedback mechanism to those who need to know, and by the system’s attributes, described below.</p>
<p>In Module 1 we saw an example of how useful measles surveillance had been to prompting large scale interventions and to monitoring the successful impact of those programs.</p>
<p>Similarly, surveillance for pertussis has documented major shifts in the most commonly notified age groups over the last decade with subsequent changes to the immunisation schedule in Australia, another example of surveillance very usefully informing the public health response.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="program-characteristics">Program characteristics</h2>
<p>The qualities or characteristics on the next 2 pages describe the operation and usefulness of a surveillance system. To evaluate a surveillance system we must assess, either qualitatively or quantitatively, each of these. Refer to the CDC Guidelines for evaluating Public Health Surveillance for an extended discussion on each of these attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Simplicity refers to the structure and ease of operation of the system as a whole and each of its components (case definitions, reporting procedures, etc.). In general, a surveillance system should be as simple as possible while still meeting its objectives. A simple system is more likely to provide timely data with fewer resource needs than a complex system. Simplicity is also closely related to acceptability and affects the resources required to operate the system.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>Flexibility refers to the ability of a surveillance system to accommodate changes in operating conditions or information needs with little additional cost in time, personnel or funds. Usually, flexibility is necessary when changes occur in case definitions, or reporting forms and procedures. Flexibility also includes the system’s ability to add new health events.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptability</strong></p>
<p>Acceptability reflects the willingness of individuals and organisations to participate in a surveillance system including those who report cases, those who manage the system and those who are responsible for any public health response. We may gauge acceptability of reporting by the proportion that report cases (of those who should report) and by how complete their report forms are. For systems that use interviews with subjects, acceptability may also be measured by interview completion rates. In general, acceptability of reporting is influenced greatly by how much time the reporter must invest.</p>
<p>We may also consider acceptability in terms of the intended link with programs. Are the program managers and others responsible for action responsive to the information provided by the surveillance system?</p>
<p><strong>Timeliness</strong></p>
<p>Timeliness is the availability of data in time for appropriate action. Public health authorities may not be able to initiate prompt intervention or provide timely feedback if delays occur in any aspect of a surveillance system whether in data collection, management, analysis, interpretation, or dissemination.</p>
<p>The priority placed on timeliness will depend on the purpose of the system. An outbreak of measles or a new COVID-19 case notification  require a rapid response whereas changing trends in coronary heart disease are less time critical and can be disseminated to a population gradually.</p>
<p>The use of electronic data transmission and web-based surveillance systems have improved timeliness and data quality. Think back to readings 3 and 4 and the differences electronic systems made with tracking and following up COVID-19 cases in Taiwan and the US.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
<p>Stability is the reliability and availability of the system, that is, its ability to work as intended when needed. The human resources, hardware and software available to the surveillance system may influence stability.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="epidemiological-characteristics">Epidemiological characteristics</h2>
<p><strong>Data Quality</strong></p>
<p>Data quality refers to the completeness and validity of the data. The frequency of missing data provides a ready measure of completeness. Assessing validity requires a comparison with ‘true’ values from another source such as an audit of notification forms or comparison with other data collections. The sensitivity and predictive value positive of the system will also influence data quality. Data quality needs to be understood to be able to interpret the data and to understand its representativeness.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity</strong></p>
<p>Sensitivity is the ability of a system to detect the cases or other health events it is intended to detect. We may measure sensitivity by conducting a representative survey to establish the true frequency of the health event in the population under surveillance and comparing the results with those from the surveillance system.</p>
<p>Sensitivity also refers to the system’s ability to detect epidemics, outbreaks and other changes in disease occurrence. As noted earlier, many surveillance systems detect only a small proportion of the cases that actually occur. The type of surveillance – active, passive or sentinel may influence this. We must then assess whether a system that is not 100% sensitive in terms of individual cases is nonetheless sufficiently sensitive to identify community-wide problems.</p>
<p>Systems that do not have high sensitivity may still provide a useful measure of trends provided the sensitivity remains stable. However, surveillance artefacts may result if sensitivity changes substantially. Increased sensitivity may occur, for example, with the introduction of a new clinical test that picks up cases earlier or with increased public awareness so more people attend and have a test performed. In these situations it may be challenging to distinguish such artefactual increases in surveillance detected cases from a genuine increase in disease in the population.</p>
<p>Surveillance for genital chlamydia infection will usually have low sensitivity as many infected people will have no symptoms and will likely not present for testing. Surveillance data still provide useful epidemiological information but if there are changes in these data they need to be considered in the context of any developments that might vary the level of surveillance sensitivity. The introduction of a more sensitive PCR test in the 1990’s, for example, contributed to the significant increase in notifications at that time. It is important to make sure that test sensitivity is not confused with the sensitivity of a surveillance system overall, with the latter potentially affected by all the factors noted above.</p>
<p><strong>Predictive Value Positive</strong></p>
<p>Predictive value positive is the proportion of reported cases, which truly are cases, or the proportion of reported epidemics, which are actual epidemics. That is, it is a measure of the predictive value of a reported case or epidemic.</p>
<p>We measure predictive value positive by investigating whether the reported cases and epidemics meet our definition for a true case or real epidemic. The more ‘false-positive’ reports there are in a surveillance system, the lower the predictive value of the reports. These result in unnecessary investigations, wasteful allocation of resources, and – especially for false reports of epidemics – unwarranted public anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Representativeness</strong></p>
<p>Representativeness is the extent to which a surveillance system accurately portrays the incidence of a health event in an entire population by person, place, and time. It includes the quality or accuracy of the data provided and is influenced by the acceptability and sensitivity of the system. For us to generalise or draw conclusions about a community using surveillance data, the system must be representative. In calculating rates from surveillance data, it is important not to assume, without evaluation, that the system is representative. In evaluating the representativeness of a system, we seek to identify important subpopulations systematically excluded or under represented by the system.</p>
<p>Consider several examples. Notification rates for genital chlamydia are consistently higher in females than males in New South Wales. Are the levels of chlamydia in the tested population representative of the broader community? We know that this is not the case and that at a community level rates of infection are very similar in males and females. The notification rates are a result of differences in testing. Females visit their general practitioners more frequently, have much higher rates of testing and a higher proportion of their infections are detected. However if subpopulations are looked at within the male population – there are discrepancies in testing rater. Males that identify as men who have sex with men (MSM) have higher notification rates than those that do not identify as MSM. Thus comparing males and females alone without looking at the subpopulations means you cannot understand how to apply the data to the broader community.</p>
<p>During the widespread influenza pandemic in 2009 some small country towns in NSW had very low rates of influenza notified. For many this was not representative of the level of influenza infection in those communities but resulted from reduced access to health care and laboratory testing. COVID-19 has shown us internationally that some countries had ‘low’ levels of cases – some reporting none at all despite being surrounded by other countries with high rates of infections. This highlighted access to testing for these areas – with various reasons such as lack of political belief or will to introduce testing, lack of access due to poor health infrastructure and community suspicion regarding testing and the public health ramifications of a positive test result.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>We evaluate a surveillance system so that we can draw conclusions about its present state and make recommendations about its future potential. In our conclusions, we should state whether the system addresses an important public health problem, whether it is meeting its objectives, and whether it is operating efficiently. If it is not doing these things, we should recommend modifications in the system, or address the question of whether the system should be continued at all.</p>
<p>In making recommendations for modifications, we must recognise that the various attributes and costs are interrelated and potentially conflicting. For example, efforts to improve sensitivity may reduce predictive value positive and timeliness may be adversely affected by efforts to collect a detailed data set. For any surveillance system, some attributes are more important than others. We must consider each attribute and its relative importance to ensure that the system’s objectives will be met.</p>
<p>You should read the ‘The updated guidelines for evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems’ from the Centers for Disease Control on this link.
