For example, an order \\(N\\) meta-analysis has \\(N+2\\) treatment arms. A 'triangular meta-analysis' is of order \\(1\\) . This means there are 3 treatment arms (A, B and C). Data extraction DECiMAL (Data Extration for Complex Meta-analysis) Example data extraction For multivariate, and network meta-analysis information Key items for data extraction Bibliographic information (e.g. study ID) Trial characteristics Patient characteristics (for study level and arm level) Intervention and comparator(s) Outcomes (continuous vs. binary, aggregate measures vs. 2x2 table, end of study vs. change values) Risk of Bias Don't use covidence, etc. if you are trying to pool a network meta-analysis Notes: Quality control and data cleaning are critical (e.g. incorrectly placed decimals could stop the whole process!) Network meta-analyses could end up with hundreds of data points - you NEED to systematically look for mistakes Do descriptive statistics (e.g. Mean, IQR, etc.) to make sure your numbers aren't off If you are not sure between SD and SE, contact the authors to make sure - SE is typically very small compared to SD - unless it is specified, take care! Data extraction formats Conventional vs. network meta-analysis Conventional: Wide format (one row per study), multiple worksheets (for each study) Wide format (one row per study), one worksheet Compact wide format (one row per study), one worksheet Long format (one row per arm) - preferred format for NMA Preparing data for NMA Count data Command in Stata: network setup eventvar nvar [if] [in], studyvar(varname) trtvar(varname) [or|rr|rd|hr zeroadd(#)] ref(string) Default is OR Continuous data: Command in Stata: network setup meanvar sdvar nvar [if] [in], trtvar(varname) studyvar(varname) [md|smd] ref(string) Default is SMD Software will automatically do continuity corrections (e.g. 0 in certain arms). You can also tell the study which study is your reference - whilst different results should give the same result, choosing a reference treatment to be central in the network (the better-connected treatment) may improve numerical stability. Usually placebo/no treatment is the reference, but you might want to pick a treatment arm. Assumptions of indirect comparisons Homogeneity assumption Undertaken using \\(I^2\\) , Cochran Q test, P-value for signifiance. An \\(I^2 = 0\\) means there is no statistical heterogeneity, but there might be a conceptual heterogeneity. Transivity Assumption (Similarity assumption) - extra for NMA Similar to conceptual heterogeneity. If you have drug A having a common comparator to B and C - if AB is cross-over and AC is parallel design, this violates transivity assumption of methodology. If A vs B uses Visual analogue scale, and A vs C uses a McGill pain questionnaire, this could violate transivity assumption. If A is 'weight watcher' and B is 'Dash diet' and C is 'Mediterranean diet', and every study in A vs B receieves counseling, but all studies A vs C didn't use counseling - this cointervention can change the treatment, and so it is a violation of the transivitity assumption. Transivity assumption applies to: Patients - e.g. patients of different ages between interventions Be careful when considering patients - you shouldn't rely on Table 1 patient distributions to determine transivity (e.g. consideration of age). Transitivity isn't black and white - there will always be differences in patient backgrounds. It is up to you to determine HOW MUCH and HOW MUCH WILL IT MATTER, rather than yes/no. Co-interventions Outcomes Methodology Note there is NO WAY to test for transivity, it depends on your own judgement (do you think there is a fundamental difference between the trials?) Coherence assumption (Similarity assumption) Can be assessed pairwise, loop-specific, and in-network. The assumption is STATISTIC (p-value attached to it). Statistical approaches for Indirect Treatment Comparisons (ITC) ITCs are not new. Bucher et al. (1997) demonstrated the simplest form. The process is as follows: Given odds ratio of study 1) (A vs B) and study 2) (A vs C), and you want to determine how B compares against C:A vs. C and number of studies B vs. C: Calculate the log(OR(A vs B)) and log(OR(A vs C)) Calculate log(OR(A vs B)) : log(OR(A vs C)) If this ratio > 1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) , B is better than C. This method is the simpliest approach to a triangular meta-analysis. If you are going over loop of 3, and don't construct a connected network, it becomes a adjusted indirect treatment comparison (rather than simply ITC). Assumptions for each level of multiple treatment comparison Homogeneity assumption in pairwise function Ensure there is no considerable heterogeneity in each pairwise comparison Homogeneity and similarity of trial Check similarity or transitivity assumption in loops. What if I have multiple interventions NOT in a loop? Consider the following study - imagine we were assessing the effect of different interventions on smoking cessation. In our first order loop ('triangle' loop), we: Directly compare the effect of NRT vs Anti-depressants The meta-analysis here involves 3 trials, demonstrating OR of 1.34 (0.71 - 2.56) with \\(I^2 = 0.437\\) Indirectly compare NRT to control and Anti-depressants to control The meta-analysis of NRT vs control is equal to 1.85, \\(I^2 = 0.13\\) involving 67 comparisons. The meta-analysis of Antidepressants vs control is equal to 1.88, \\(I^2 = 0.19\\) , involving 29 comparisons. When undertaking simple ITC, we get the indirect score of 1.01 (0.81 - 0.127). This network actually has another second order loop which compares antidepressant vs NRT as well. For this, we can ALSO calculate the direct and indirect comparisons. In fact, there are a NUMBER of different loops involving NRT and Anti-depressants. In this example, there are five separate loops involving anti-depressants vs NRT. How do we then calculate the network effect? The network effect is calculated by undertaking a simple meta-analysis of the calculated indirect loops . This will be affected by: The order of the loop - lower loops have higher weight The standard error of the indirect effect ( \\(weight = \\frac{1}{SE}\\) ) By pooling the direct and pooled-indirect estimates, you can calculate the network estimate. The relative weighting of the direct and pool-indirect estimates is calculated on a contribution table (or contribution plot). Useful to check when doing GRADE assessments. Other statistical approaches to network meta-analysis Frequentist framework Bayestian framework - more popular for analysis of published networks Philosophically, frequentist and bayesian approaches are different statistical approaches. Both are concerned with parameter estimation (inference of something about a population taken from a sample). From a probabilistic perspective, we don't know what the parameter is - as we can't find a point estimate, we also need to come up with a distribution (i.e. the 95% confidence interval). These frameworks approach distributions differently. However, Empirical and simulation studies have shown NMAs from frequentist models do not differ from Bayesian models with vague(flat/uninformative) priors. Bayesian framework for NMA Look at probability in a general way - yes the probability is unknown, but we can use a probability to represent the uncertainty in this value. Example - looking at height: I agree that the mean is a fixed and known value, but i know it is not 0 and it is not 50cm, I know it cannot be >3m. I know there is no issue with calculating the uncertainty through a probabilistic means. I can come up with a probability but imaginative distribution of height in this population. I will use 1+ samples from this population, have an estimate and 95% CI, and also a probability distribution regarding what comes out of the sample. Bayesian models have more flexibility: - informative vs. vague priors for effect estimates - Vague prior = very wide normal distribution, which captures every possibility in a priori distribution/parameter. Very wide distribution from 0 to infinity, but we know it is normally distributed - semi-informative prior = noting the probability that the distribution is going to be from 20cm to 1000cm in height - there is still a wide range of values, but our approach is still semi-informative (not 0 to infinity). We still assume a normal shaped distribution - Fully-informative priors = still attached to a credible interval, but the values are more informed by previous studies (i.e. there is evidence to support the range of values/intervals) - Informative priors requires justification - Arm-based model vs. Contrast-based model - Able to look into effect modifications at arm-level covariates in arm-based models compared to contrast-based models - Arm based model advantage - covariate/intervention/effect modifier affecting arm-level estimates, and I want to adjust for that arm-level value. - Assumption: Prognostic factors are distributed equally if randomisation is done correctly between trial arms - usually, it is unrealistic to think there is effect modification for a prognostic factor at arm level - as a result, Arm-level NMA is not usually different from Contrast-based models - Variable between-study variances (heterogeneity) vs. common between-study variance - frequentists normally use common between-study variance for heterogeneity. - Say you have 13 intervention and 25 comparisons, - each comparison has a heterogeneity estimate ( \\(I^2\\) estimate) - the estimate of heterogeneity is different - In frequentist NMA, there is typically a single heterogeneity estimate for the whole network - DIC (deviance information criteria) and \\(D_{hat}\\) statistics (model fit) provide information regarding whether you picked the right model. This is only available to Bayesian models, and is a benefit of the flexibility. - Fixed vs. Random effects - Consistency vs. inconsistence - Network meta-regression vs NMA Frequentist framework for NMA Do not attach a-priori probability to hypothesis regarding parameter in the population. We know it is a fixed value, but we don't know what it is. Example - looking at height I don't know the mean value of height in the female population I know this value is FIXED and NOT RANDOM - I can use a sample population and estimate the mean from the sample, which will give me a probability distribution of this mean. I will use 1+ samples from this population and come up with an estimate and 95% CI around the estimate References These notes were made based on: Behnam Sadeghirad's youtube videos Video 1 , Video 2 , Video 3 and Video 4 Cochrane handbook chapter 11 (Network meta-analysis) here Cochrane network meta-analysis learning modules here","title":"Network meta-analysis"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Advanced%20methods/Advanced%20meta-analysis/networkmetaanalysis/#network-meta-analysis","text":"","title":"Network meta-analysis"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Advanced%20methods/Advanced%20meta-analysis/networkmetaanalysis/#terminology","text":"Terminology for meta-analysis: Order The order of the network meta-analysis indicates the number of treatment arms included in this meta-analysis.

Where covariates are unavailable, and time is the only variable available, then this is when we use time-series forecasting. We look at how time affects the outcome \\(y\\) . What is a time series? A series of data taken at different points in time. Examples include: - Stock prices of a single stock across various time periods By its definition, time series data cannot be cross-sectional data This data may be collected at regular time periods (i.e. the interval between collecting data is exactly the same - \\(t_2 - t_1 = t_1 - t_0\\) ) Forms of time series Univariate Time series Time series consisting of single observations over regular time intervals - for example, monthly returns data of a stock. Aim is to use past values of series data to predict future values - e.g. stocks, GDP, sales data e.g. forecasting inflation, unemployment rates, exchange rates, product demands, interest rates Multivariate Time series Emerging patterns Depending on the frequency of data collection, we have different resolutions in our data - this allows for different patterns to emerge from the same situation (with differently collected data frequencies). Some example emerging patterns which may be observed: Trend data Upward or downward sloping long term direction persisting Seasonal data E.g. sales data Related to seasonal natural or human behaviour Cyclic data Pattern may last > 1 year Series follow up- and down- variations that are not seasonal E.g. budget patterns - might change across multiple years, resulting from recession/inflation - would expect to see a wave-like pattern Cycles may not necessarily be regular Random data Any data with no particular pattern - cannot be explained Irregularities Could be due to one-off issues occuring in data collection Stationarity A \"strictly stationary\" series is if the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\) at time \\(t[p(Y_t)]\\) is the same as at any other point in time. Therefore \\(p(Y_t) = p(Y_{t+k})\\) and \\(p(Y_t, Y_{t+k})\\) does not depend on \\(t\\) , where \\(t\\ge1\\) and \\(k\\) is any integer. This implies that mean, variance of covariant of series \\(Y_t\\) are time invariant A series is \"weakly stationary\" or \"covariance stationary\" if the following conditions are met: \\(E(Y_1) = E(Y_2) = E(Y_3) = ... = E(Y_t) = \\mu(constant)\\) \\(Var(Y_1) = Var(Y_2) = Var(Y_3) = ... = Var(Y_t) = \\gamma_0 (constant)\\) \\(Cov(Y_1, Y_{1+k}) = Cov(Y_2, Y_{2+k}) = Cov(Y_3, Y_{3+k}) = \\gamma_k\\) depending only on lag \\(k\\) . Stationarity assumption Estimation and forecasting methods The Box-Jenkins (B-J) methodology is used to estimate and forecast univariate time-series models. This includes the steps: Identification Autocorrelation function (ACF) Autocorrelation refers to how observations in a time series are related to each other, and is measured by a correlation between the current observation \\(Y_t\\) and the observation \\(p\\) periods from the current one \\(Y_{t-p}\\) . \\(\\rho_k = Corr(Y_t, Y_{t-p}) = \\frac{Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-p})}{\\sqrt{var(Y_t)}\\sqrt{var(Y_{t-p})}} = \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\gamma_0}\\) Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) Partial autocorrelations are used to measure the degree of association between \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-p}\\) when the effects at other time lags \\(1, 2, 3, ..., (p-1)\\) are removed - essentially like the ACF but we remove a few of the intermediate values. Inference from ACF and PACF Theoretical ACF and PACFs are available for various values of the lags of autoregressive and moving average components - e.g. \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) . A comparison of the correlograms (plot of sample ACFs vs. lags) of the time series data with theoretical ACFs and PACFs leads to the selection of the appropriate ARIMA \\((p, q)\\) model. Estimation Estimation methods usually determined by software Yule-Walker procedure Method of moments Maximum likelihood method Diagnostic checking Lowest value of AIC/BIC/SBIC - choose model with the lowest value of the criterion Plot the residual ACF - expect random residuals This method can only be applied to stationary series/variables. If the model is not stationary, you must differentiate and make the dataset stationary. Time series processes and models White noise A time series is 'white noise' if it is purely random in nature. Let \\(\\epsilon_t\\) denote such a series. Then it has a zero mean \\(E(\\epsilon_t) = 0\\) , a constant variance \\(V(\\epsilon_t) = \\sigma^2\\) , and is an uncorrelated random variable \\(E(\\epsilon_t \\epsilon_s) = 0\\) . The scatter plot of such a plot will indicate no pattern - forecasting future values of such a series is not possible. i.e. STOP DOING TIME SERIES FORECASTING - it will be pointless The best forecast available for white noise is its average AutoRegressive (AR) models AutoRegressive (AR) models involve forecasting performed only on its own past values. That is, for a prediction \\(Y_t\\) , the forecast function is given as \\(Y_t = f(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, Y_{t-3}, ..., \\epsilon_t)\\) The question in these models is when do we stop taking past values (i.e. how many values of past \\(Y\\) should we take?) The general form is given by: \\(Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Y_{t-1}+\\beta_2Y_{t-2}+\\beta_3Y_{t-3} + ... + \\beta_pY_{t-p}+\\epsilon_t\\) Moving Average (MA) model Moving average (MA) models involve forecasting by error terms - Consider forecasting each time-series point using its previous point: \\(Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_1\\) \\(Y_{t-1} = Y_{t-2} + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_2\\) \\(Y_{t-2} = Y_{t-3} + \\beta_2 + \\epsilon_3\\) We would expect that the error terms \\(\\epsilon\\) are effectively white noise processes and have a mean of \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) (a constant). In the moving average (MA) model, we form a function on the error terms: \\(Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_t + \\Phi_1\\epsilon_{t-1}+\\Phi_2\\epsilon_{t-2}+\\Phi_3\\epsilon_{t-3}+...+\\Phi_q\\epsilon_{t-q}\\) AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model People believe this model is more accurate than simple AutoRegressive or Moving Average models individually. The ARMA model depends on \\(p\\) , its own past values and \\(q\\) , the past values of white noise disturbances. The general formula takes the form: \\(Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Y_{t-1}+\\beta_2Y_{t-2}+\\beta_3Y_{t-3}+...+\\beta_pY_{t-p}+\\epsilon_t+\\Phi_1\\epsilon_{t-1}+\\Phi_2\\epsilon_{t-2}+\\Phi_3\\epsilon_{t-3}+...+\\Phi_q\\epsilon_{t-q}\\) AutoRegressive Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) model ARIMA models are applied to models with non-stationary series. A series which is stationary after being differentiated once is to be integrated of order 1, denoted \\(I(1)\\) . In its general form, a series which is stationary after being differentiated \\(d\\) times is denoted \\(I(d)\\) . A stationary series without differentiating is denoted \\(I(0)\\) .

It is stored in R environment as an object with this name. Arguments \u2212 An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values. Function Body \u2212 The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does. Return Value \u2212 The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.
