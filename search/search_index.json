We need to consider the question: Why the data is missing in the first place? . The missing-ness of data can be classified in three ways: Missing completely at random (MCAR) Missing at random (MAR) Missing NOT at random (MNAR) Missing completely at random (MCAR) This is the best form of missingness - it means that the data is missing completely by chance. The reason for missingness is not due to any issue consistent within the population . This type of randomness has a similar distribution to if we selected a completely random sample of individuals from the population, and deleted some of their data. With this type of missingness, you should have a valid complete case analysis (i.e. the results should be similar), however the only issue with a complete case analysis is a reduction in power. Missing data is almost never missing at random. Missing at random (MAR) Missing at random implies that the missingness is dependent on another variable observed - there is some relationship between this variable and another variable. For example, if we collect data including age, exercise tolerance, etc. and find that exercise tolerance data appears to be missing more commonly in older individuals (perhaps they are embarassed?), then we would say this data is missing at random (However not completely at random). One way of describing this could be 'missing conditionally at random' - where there is a presupposed condition that is observed (in this case older individuals), which makes missingness more common, however the actual observations which are missing are still random. This is the type of data which is best dealt with using imputation. Missing not at random (MNAR) This is missingness dependent on another variable not observed . Examples include Data missing in sicker patients, but we have not measured health status Smoking status not recorded on emergency presentation, however this group of people appear to have worse surgical outcomes The only way to properly determine if missingness is MNAR is by collecting data that is missing - however this is not usuallyh achievable.

For example, an order \\(N\\) meta-analysis has \\(N+2\\) treatment arms. A 'triangular meta-analysis' is of order \\(1\\) . This means there are 3 treatment arms (A, B and C). Data extraction DECiMAL (Data Extration for Complex Meta-analysis) Example data extraction For multivariate, and network meta-analysis information Key items for data extraction Bibliographic information (e.g. study ID) Trial characteristics Patient characteristics (for study level and arm level) Intervention and comparator(s) Outcomes (continuous vs. binary, aggregate measures vs. 2x2 table, end of study vs. change values) Risk of Bias Don't use covidence, etc. if you are trying to pool a network meta-analysis Notes: Quality control and data cleaning are critical (e.g. incorrectly placed decimals could stop the whole process!) Network meta-analyses could end up with hundreds of data points - you NEED to systematically look for mistakes Do descriptive statistics (e.g. Mean, IQR, etc.) to make sure your numbers aren't off If you are not sure between SD and SE, contact the authors to make sure - SE is typically very small compared to SD - unless it is specified, take care! Data extraction formats Conventional vs. network meta-analysis Conventional: Wide format (one row per study), multiple worksheets (for each study) Wide format (one row per study), one worksheet Compact wide format (one row per study), one worksheet Long format (one row per arm) - preferred format for NMA Preparing data for NMA Count data Command in Stata: network setup eventvar nvar [if] [in], studyvar(varname) trtvar(varname) [or|rr|rd|hr zeroadd(#)] ref(string) Default is OR Continuous data: Command in Stata: network setup meanvar sdvar nvar [if] [in], trtvar(varname) studyvar(varname) [md|smd] ref(string) Default is SMD Software will automatically do continuity corrections (e.g. 0 in certain arms). You can also tell the study which study is your reference - whilst different results should give the same result, choosing a reference treatment to be central in the network (the better-connected treatment) may improve numerical stability. Usually placebo/no treatment is the reference, but you might want to pick a treatment arm. Assumptions of indirect comparisons Homogeneity assumption Undertaken using \\(I^2\\) , Cochran Q test, P-value for signifiance. An \\(I^2 = 0\\) means there is no statistical heterogeneity, but there might be a conceptual heterogeneity. Transivity Assumption (Similarity assumption) - extra for NMA Similar to conceptual heterogeneity. If you have drug A having a common comparator to B and C - if AB is cross-over and AC is parallel design, this violates transivity assumption of methodology. If A vs B uses Visual analogue scale, and A vs C uses a McGill pain questionnaire, this could violate transivity assumption. If A is 'weight watcher' and B is 'Dash diet' and C is 'Mediterranean diet', and every study in A vs B receieves counseling, but all studies A vs C didn't use counseling - this cointervention can change the treatment, and so it is a violation of the transivitity assumption. Transivity assumption applies to: Patients - e.g. patients of different ages between interventions Be careful when considering patients - you shouldn't rely on Table 1 patient distributions to determine transivity (e.g. consideration of age). Transitivity isn't black and white - there will always be differences in patient backgrounds. It is up to you to determine HOW MUCH and HOW MUCH WILL IT MATTER, rather than yes/no. Co-interventions Outcomes Methodology Note there is NO WAY to test for transivity, it depends on your own judgement (do you think there is a fundamental difference between the trials?) Coherence assumption (Similarity assumption) Can be assessed pairwise, loop-specific, and in-network. The assumption is STATISTIC (p-value attached to it). Statistical approaches for Indirect Treatment Comparisons (ITC) ITCs are not new. Bucher et al. (1997) demonstrated the simplest form. The process is as follows: Given odds ratio of study 1) (A vs B) and study 2) (A vs C), and you want to determine how B compares against C:A vs. C and number of studies B vs. C: Calculate the log(OR(A vs B)) and log(OR(A vs C)) Calculate log(OR(A vs B)) : log(OR(A vs C)) If this ratio > 1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) , B is better than C. This method is the simpliest approach to a triangular meta-analysis. If you are going over loop of 3, and don't construct a connected network, it becomes a adjusted indirect treatment comparison (rather than simply ITC). Assumptions for each level of multiple treatment comparison Homogeneity assumption in pairwise function Ensure there is no considerable heterogeneity in each pairwise comparison Homogeneity and similarity of trial Check similarity or transitivity assumption in loops. What if I have multiple interventions NOT in a loop? Consider the following study - imagine we were assessing the effect of different interventions on smoking cessation. In our first order loop ('triangle' loop), we: Directly compare the effect of NRT vs Anti-depressants The meta-analysis here involves 3 trials, demonstrating OR of 1.34 (0.71 - 2.56) with \\(I^2 = 0.437\\) Indirectly compare NRT to control and Anti-depressants to control The meta-analysis of NRT vs control is equal to 1.85, \\(I^2 = 0.13\\) involving 67 comparisons. The meta-analysis of Antidepressants vs control is equal to 1.88, \\(I^2 = 0.19\\) , involving 29 comparisons. When undertaking simple ITC, we get the indirect score of 1.01 (0.81 - 0.127). This network actually has another second order loop which compares antidepressant vs NRT as well. For this, we can ALSO calculate the direct and indirect comparisons. In fact, there are a NUMBER of different loops involving NRT and Anti-depressants. In this example, there are five separate loops involving anti-depressants vs NRT. How do we then calculate the network effect? The network effect is calculated by undertaking a simple meta-analysis of the calculated indirect loops . This will be affected by: The order of the loop - lower loops have higher weight The standard error of the indirect effect ( \\(weight = \\frac{1}{SE}\\) ) By pooling the direct and pooled-indirect estimates, you can calculate the network estimate. The relative weighting of the direct and pool-indirect estimates is calculated on a contribution table (or contribution plot). Useful to check when doing GRADE assessments. Other statistical approaches to network meta-analysis Frequentist framework Bayestian framework - more popular for analysis of published networks Philosophically, frequentist and bayesian approaches are different statistical approaches. Both are concerned with parameter estimation (inference of something about a population taken from a sample). From a probabilistic perspective, we don't know what the parameter is - as we can't find a point estimate, we also need to come up with a distribution (i.e. the 95% confidence interval). These frameworks approach distributions differently. However, Empirical and simulation studies have shown NMAs from frequentist models do not differ from Bayesian models with vague(flat/uninformative) priors. Bayesian framework for NMA Look at probability in a general way - yes the probability is unknown, but we can use a probability to represent the uncertainty in this value. Example - looking at height: I agree that the mean is a fixed and known value, but i know it is not 0 and it is not 50cm, I know it cannot be >3m. I know there is no issue with calculating the uncertainty through a probabilistic means. I can come up with a probability but imaginative distribution of height in this population. I will use 1+ samples from this population, have an estimate and 95% CI, and also a probability distribution regarding what comes out of the sample. Bayesian models have more flexibility: - informative vs. vague priors for effect estimates - Vague prior = very wide normal distribution, which captures every possibility in a priori distribution/parameter. Very wide distribution from 0 to infinity, but we know it is normally distributed - semi-informative prior = noting the probability that the distribution is going to be from 20cm to 1000cm in height - there is still a wide range of values, but our approach is still semi-informative (not 0 to infinity). We still assume a normal shaped distribution - Fully-informative priors = still attached to a credible interval, but the values are more informed by previous studies (i.e. there is evidence to support the range of values/intervals) - Informative priors requires justification - Arm-based model vs. Contrast-based model - Able to look into effect modifications at arm-level covariates in arm-based models compared to contrast-based models - Arm based model advantage - covariate/intervention/effect modifier affecting arm-level estimates, and I want to adjust for that arm-level value. - Assumption: Prognostic factors are distributed equally if randomisation is done correctly between trial arms - usually, it is unrealistic to think there is effect modification for a prognostic factor at arm level - as a result, Arm-level NMA is not usually different from Contrast-based models - Variable between-study variances (heterogeneity) vs. common between-study variance - frequentists normally use common between-study variance for heterogeneity. - Say you have 13 intervention and 25 comparisons, - each comparison has a heterogeneity estimate ( \\(I^2\\) estimate) - the estimate of heterogeneity is different - In frequentist NMA, there is typically a single heterogeneity estimate for the whole network - DIC (deviance information criteria) and \\(D_{hat}\\) statistics (model fit) provide information regarding whether you picked the right model. This is only available to Bayesian models, and is a benefit of the flexibility. - Fixed vs. Random effects - Consistency vs. inconsistence - Network meta-regression vs NMA Frequentist framework for NMA Do not attach a-priori probability to hypothesis regarding parameter in the population. We know it is a fixed value, but we don't know what it is. Example - looking at height I don't know the mean value of height in the female population I know this value is FIXED and NOT RANDOM - I can use a sample population and estimate the mean from the sample, which will give me a probability distribution of this mean. I will use 1+ samples from this population and come up with an estimate and 95% CI around the estimate References These notes were made based on: Behnam Sadeghirad's youtube videos Video 1 , Video 2 , Video 3 and Video 4 Cochrane handbook chapter 11 (Network meta-analysis) here Cochrane network meta-analysis learning modules here","title":"Network meta-analysis"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Advanced%20methods/Advanced%20meta-analysis/Network%20meta-analysis/#network-meta-analysis","text":"","title":"Network meta-analysis"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Advanced%20methods/Advanced%20meta-analysis/Network%20meta-analysis/#terminology","text":"Terminology for meta-analysis: Order The order of the network meta-analysis indicates the number of treatment arms included in this meta-analysis.

If you have drug A having a common comparator to B and C - if AB is cross-over and AC is parallel design, this violates transivity assumption of methodology. If A vs B uses Visual analogue scale, and A vs C uses a McGill pain questionnaire, this could violate transivity assumption. If A is 'weight watcher' and B is 'Dash diet' and C is 'Mediterranean diet', and every study in A vs B receieves counseling, but all studies A vs C didn't use counseling - this cointervention can change the treatment, and so it is a violation of the transivitity assumption. Transivity assumption applies to: Patients - e.g. patients of different ages between interventions Be careful when considering patients - you shouldn't rely on Table 1 patient distributions to determine transivity (e.g. consideration of age). Transitivity isn't black and white - there will always be differences in patient backgrounds. It is up to you to determine HOW MUCH and HOW MUCH WILL IT MATTER, rather than yes/no.

In fact, there are a NUMBER of different loops involving NRT and Anti-depressants. In this example, there are five separate loops involving anti-depressants vs NRT. How do we then calculate the network effect? The network effect is calculated by undertaking a simple meta-analysis of the calculated indirect loops . This will be affected by: The order of the loop - lower loops have higher weight The standard error of the indirect effect ( \\(weight = \\frac{1}{SE}\\) ) By pooling the direct and pooled-indirect estimates, you can calculate the network estimate.

I know there is no issue with calculating the uncertainty through a probabilistic means. I can come up with a probability but imaginative distribution of height in this population. I will use 1+ samples from this population, have an estimate and 95% CI, and also a probability distribution regarding what comes out of the sample. Bayesian models have more flexibility: - informative vs. vague priors for effect estimates - Vague prior = very wide normal distribution, which captures every possibility in a priori distribution/parameter. Very wide distribution from 0 to infinity, but we know it is normally distributed - semi-informative prior = noting the probability that the distribution is going to be from 20cm to 1000cm in height - there is still a wide range of values, but our approach is still semi-informative (not 0 to infinity). We still assume a normal shaped distribution - Fully-informative priors = still attached to a credible interval, but the values are more informed by previous studies (i.e. there is evidence to support the range of values/intervals) - Informative priors requires justification - Arm-based model vs. Contrast-based model - Able to look into effect modifications at arm-level covariates in arm-based models compared to contrast-based models - Arm based model advantage - covariate/intervention/effect modifier affecting arm-level estimates, and I want to adjust for that arm-level value. - Assumption: Prognostic factors are distributed equally if randomisation is done correctly between trial arms - usually, it is unrealistic to think there is effect modification for a prognostic factor at arm level - as a result, Arm-level NMA is not usually different from Contrast-based models - Variable between-study variances (heterogeneity) vs. common between-study variance - frequentists normally use common between-study variance for heterogeneity. - Say you have 13 intervention and 25 comparisons, - each comparison has a heterogeneity estimate ( \\(I^2\\) estimate) - the estimate of heterogeneity is different - In frequentist NMA, there is typically a single heterogeneity estimate for the whole network - DIC (deviance information criteria) and \\(D_{hat}\\) statistics (model fit) provide information regarding whether you picked the right model.

Examples of other forecasting models include linear regression -type models. In regression models, the general form is \\(y=a+bx\\) - in these models, we might not always have the relevant variables to do the forecasting. We might only have \\(y\\) -values for certain time periods, but we might lack the explanatory covariates \\(x\\) . Where covariates are unavailable, and time is the only variable available, then this is when we use time-series forecasting. We look at how time affects the outcome \\(y\\) . What is a time series? A series of data taken at different points in time. Examples include: - Stock prices of a single stock across various time periods By its definition, time series data cannot be cross-sectional data This data may be collected at regular time periods (i.e. the interval between collecting data is exactly the same - \\(t_2 - t_1 = t_1 - t_0\\) ) Forms of time series Univariate Time series Time series consisting of single observations over regular time intervals - for example, monthly returns data of a stock. Aim is to use past values of series data to predict future values - e.g. stocks, GDP, sales data e.g. forecasting inflation, unemployment rates, exchange rates, product demands, interest rates Multivariate Time series Emerging patterns Depending on the frequency of data collection, we have different resolutions in our data - this allows for different patterns to emerge from the same situation (with differently collected data frequencies). Some example emerging patterns which may be observed: Trend data Upward or downward sloping long term direction persisting Seasonal data E.g. sales data Related to seasonal natural or human behaviour Cyclic data Pattern may last > 1 year Series follow up- and down- variations that are not seasonal E.g. budget patterns - might change across multiple years, resulting from recession/inflation - would expect to see a wave-like pattern Cycles may not necessarily be regular Random data Any data with no particular pattern - cannot be explained Irregularities Could be due to one-off issues occuring in data collection Stationarity A \"strictly stationary\" series is if the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\) at time \\(t[p(Y_t)]\\) is the same as at any other point in time. Therefore \\(p(Y_t) = p(Y_{t+k})\\) and \\(p(Y_t, Y_{t+k})\\) does not depend on \\(t\\) , where \\(t\\ge1\\) and \\(k\\) is any integer. This implies that mean, variance of covariant of series \\(Y_t\\) are time invariant A series is \"weakly stationary\" or \"covariance stationary\" if the following conditions are met: \\(E(Y_1) = E(Y_2) = E(Y_3) = ... = E(Y_t) = \\mu(constant)\\) \\(Var(Y_1) = Var(Y_2) = Var(Y_3) = ... = Var(Y_t) = \\gamma_0 (constant)\\) \\(Cov(Y_1, Y_{1+k}) = Cov(Y_2, Y_{2+k}) = Cov(Y_3, Y_{3+k}) = \\gamma_k\\) depending only on lag \\(k\\) . Stationarity assumption Estimation and forecasting methods The Box-Jenkins (B-J) methodology is used to estimate and forecast univariate time-series models. This includes the steps: Identification Autocorrelation function (ACF) Autocorrelation refers to how observations in a time series are related to each other, and is measured by a correlation between the current observation \\(Y_t\\) and the observation \\(p\\) periods from the current one \\(Y_{t-p}\\) . \\(\\rho_k = Corr(Y_t, Y_{t-p}) = \\frac{Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-p})}{\\sqrt{var(Y_t)}\\sqrt{var(Y_{t-p})}} = \\frac{\\gamma_p}{\\gamma_0}\\) Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) Partial autocorrelations are used to measure the degree of association between \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-p}\\) when the effects at other time lags \\(1, 2, 3, ..., (p-1)\\) are removed - essentially like the ACF but we remove a few of the intermediate values. Inference from ACF and PACF Theoretical ACF and PACFs are available for various values of the lags of autoregressive and moving average components - e.g. \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) . A comparison of the correlograms (plot of sample ACFs vs. lags) of the time series data with theoretical ACFs and PACFs leads to the selection of the appropriate ARIMA \\((p, q)\\) model. Estimation Estimation methods usually determined by software Yule-Walker procedure Method of moments Maximum likelihood method Diagnostic checking Lowest value of AIC/BIC/SBIC - choose model with the lowest value of the criterion Plot the residual ACF - expect random residuals This method can only be applied to stationary series/variables. If the model is not stationary, you must differentiate and make the dataset stationary. Time series processes and models White noise A time series is 'white noise' if it is purely random in nature. Let \\(\\epsilon_t\\) denote such a series. Then it has a zero mean \\(E(\\epsilon_t) = 0\\) , a constant variance \\(V(\\epsilon_t) = \\sigma^2\\) , and is an uncorrelated random variable \\(E(\\epsilon_t \\epsilon_s) = 0\\) . The scatter plot of such a plot will indicate no pattern - forecasting future values of such a series is not possible. i.e. STOP DOING TIME SERIES FORECASTING - it will be pointless The best forecast available for white noise is its average AutoRegressive (AR) models AutoRegressive (AR) models involve forecasting performed only on its own past values. That is, for a prediction \\(Y_t\\) , the forecast function is given as \\(Y_t = f(Y_{t-1}, Y_{t-2}, Y_{t-3}, ..., \\epsilon_t)\\) The question in these models is when do we stop taking past values (i.e. how many values of past \\(Y\\) should we take?) The general form is given by: \\(Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Y_{t-1}+\\beta_2Y_{t-2}+\\beta_3Y_{t-3} + ... + \\beta_pY_{t-p}+\\epsilon_t\\) Moving Average (MA) model Moving average (MA) models involve forecasting by error terms - Consider forecasting each time-series point using its previous point: \\(Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_1\\) \\(Y_{t-1} = Y_{t-2} + \\beta_1 + \\epsilon_2\\) \\(Y_{t-2} = Y_{t-3} + \\beta_2 + \\epsilon_3\\) We would expect that the error terms \\(\\epsilon\\) are effectively white noise processes and have a mean of \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) (a constant). In the moving average (MA) model, we form a function on the error terms: \\(Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_t + \\Phi_1\\epsilon_{t-1}+\\Phi_2\\epsilon_{t-2}+\\Phi_3\\epsilon_{t-3}+...+\\Phi_q\\epsilon_{t-q}\\) AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model People believe this model is more accurate than simple AutoRegressive or Moving Average models individually. The ARMA model depends on \\(p\\) , its own past values and \\(q\\) , the past values of white noise disturbances. The general formula takes the form: \\(Y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1Y_{t-1}+\\beta_2Y_{t-2}+\\beta_3Y_{t-3}+...+\\beta_pY_{t-p}+\\epsilon_t+\\Phi_1\\epsilon_{t-1}+\\Phi_2\\epsilon_{t-2}+\\Phi_3\\epsilon_{t-3}+...+\\Phi_q\\epsilon_{t-q}\\) AutoRegressive Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) model ARIMA models are applied to models with non-stationary series. A series which is stationary after being differentiated once is to be integrated of order 1, denoted \\(I(1)\\) . In its general form, a series which is stationary after being differentiated \\(d\\) times is denoted \\(I(d)\\) . A stationary series without differentiating is denoted \\(I(0)\\) .

It is a potential confounder because its association with O may confound (i.e. distort or confuse) the relationship between E and O. All potential confounders should be tested to determine whether they are actual confounders, i.e. whether they do in fact distort the relationship between O and E. This is done by examining the size of the effect of E on O both with and without C in the model. If the size of the effect changes by a biologically or clinically important amount when C is removed from the model, then C is confounding the association between O and E. This occurs if C is associated with E. Note that the association between C and E does not need to be statistically significantly, i.e. the p-value could be >0.05. Determining whether a variable is an actual confounder cannot be assessed by examining p-value(s). Confounding can work in either direction. Positive confounding can create a spurious association between E and O or make the association appear stronger than it really is (i.e. increase the magnitude of the effect). Negative confounding can mask a real association between E and O or make the association appear weaker (smaller in magnitude) than it really is. If C (say xi) is shown to be a confounder of the relationship between O (that is, the outcome y) and the risk factor of interest, E (say xj), it should be retained in the model regardless of its statistical significance. This is because including the variable C in the model removes the bias due to confounding. A confounder may also improve the precision (i.e. reduce its standard error) of the estimated regression coefficient of the risk factor, if the confounder is strongly associated with the outcome variable, O. When assessing whether a variable is a confounder it can be useful to examine both the absolute and relative change. For linear regression, it is the absolute change in the regression coefficient that matters the most but examining the relative change can also help. Example To assess if AGE is a confounder for BMI for our bpdata.xls data, where DBP is the outcome variable, we need to examine the regression coefficient for BMI when AGE is both included (Model 3.2) and excluded from the model (Model 3.1): From the above table we would conclude that AGE is a confounder if a change of 0.4mmHg in the regression coefficient is considered clinically meaningful. Note also that the precision of the regression coefficient for BMI has improved when we included AGE in the model; with the standard error for BMI being reduced from 0.186 to 0.171. This is due to AGE being strongly associated with DBP. Intervening variables If a variable (I) is believed to be on the causal pathway from E to O, then it is important that we do not include it in the model if we are primarily interested in the effect of E on O. That is, if E determines I, which in turn determines O, then by including I in the model we would hide the effect of E on O. For example, if we were interested in the effect of dietary fat (E) on heart disease (O), then serum cholesterol level could be an intervening variable - that is, it could be that dietary fat affects cholesterol level, which in turn causes heart disease. If we included cholesterol level (I) in the model for heart disease, then we would not see the direct effect of dietary fat on heart disease, because much of that effect would be attributed to cholesterol level. Note that whether a variable is intervening is not a statistical question, but a biological one, as it depends on what we believe about the biological pathway. Therefore, a statistical test will not answer this question. If we are not sure whether a variable is intervening, we could see whether including it in the model has any effect on the association between E and O. If it does not, we can only conclude that it does not matter whether or not we include the variable in the model, as it does not affect our conclusions about the relationship of prime interest. Significant variables If a variable is not a confounder and is not an intervening variable, but is statistically significantly associated with the outcome in the multivariable model, then it should be retained in the model as it will provide a more precise estimate of the effect of E. Variables that are significant in the multivariable model will reduce the standard error of bj, the estimated effect of the risk factor of interest xj.","title":"Confounders"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Medical%20Statistics/Confounders/#confounders","text":"","title":"Confounders"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Medical%20Statistics/Confounders/#need-to-fix-this-up","text":"If a variable (C) is considered to be a risk factor for the outcome variable O, then it is a potential confounder (unless we believe that C is on the causal pathway between E and O, in which case it is an intervening variable).

Variables that are significant in the multivariable model will reduce the standard error of bj, the estimated effect of the risk factor of interest xj.","title":"Need to fix this up"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Medical%20Statistics/Data%20types/","text":"Data types","title":"Data types"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Medical%20Statistics/Data%20types/#data-types","text":"","title":"Data types"},{"location":"Biostatistics/Medical%20Statistics/Descriptive%20statistics/","text":"Descriptive statistics Terminology Types of Variables Term Definition Variable Item of data that can be observed or measured on individuals Quantitative variable A variable that can be counted or measured Discrete variable A quantitative variable whose possible values are integers (whole numbers) e.g. numbero f children, number of vitis to GP in a year Continuous variable A quantitative variable that has an uninterrupted range of values, e.g. blood presure, weight Qualitative (categorical) variable A variable that is not characterised by a numerical quantity, e.g. sex, occupation, type of housing, type of diet, category of disease Ordinal variable Qualitative variable with several ORDERED categories (e.g. very poor diet, poor, fair, good, very good) Nominal variable Qualitative variable of UNORDERED categories Dichotomous variable Qualitative variable of binary classification (yes/no) Summary data Term Definition Frequency Number of individuals with certain characteristic, or withi na certain range of a variable Relative frequency A frequency expressed as a proportion or precentage of total frequency Cumulative frequency At any value of a variable, the sum of the frequencies that are less than or equal to that value Cumulative relative frequency At any value of a variable, the sum of the frequencies that are less than or equal to that value, expressed as a proportion or percentage of the total frequency Sampling Greek letters used in statistics Summary Statistics Notation Measures of Location Mean Median Mode Selecting a representative value of location Measures of Variability Range Variance and Standard deviation Coefficient of variation Quartiles, Deciles and Centiles Tables One-way table of frequencies Maternal age (years) Frequency Relative frequency (%) Cumulative frequency Cumulative relative frequency (%) <20 163 0.3 163 0.3 20-24 3,214 6.2 3,377 6.5 25-29 10,238 19.7 13,615 26.2 30-34 20,217 38.8 33,832 65.0 30-39 14,474 27.8 48,306 92.8 >=40 3,756 7.2 52,062 100.0 Note about frequency tables: Cumulative relative frequency is not necessary to report unless categories show clear ordering (e.g. if your grouping is based on parity) Percentages should be presented as whole values when \\(n < 100\\) Do not include vertical lines in your table Columns should be labelled appropriately in whole words Two-way table of frequencies Figures Bar Charts Simple bar charts Plot quantitative discrete or qualitative variables Multiple and composite bar charts Multiple side-by-side bars or stacked bars to show relationship between variables Histograms Bars demonstrating frequency distributions of continuous variables Stem-and-leaf plots Similar to histograms, however provides more insight into detail numerically Stems are the digits to the left of the vertical line Leaves are the digits to the right of the vertical line Monospace fonts such as Courier should be used to give a macroscopic histogram on inspection Cumulative relative frequency plot Line plot where cumulative relative frequency is plotted against the independent variable/variable of interest.

A thorough evaluation should identify ways to improve the system\u2019s operation and efficiency. In a thorough evaluation, the following facets of the system should be addressed ( 1 ). A description of the surveillance system should include: The public health importance of the health event under surveillance The objectives and operation of the system The costs or resource requirements for system operation Evaluation of surveillance performance should include: The system\u2019s usefulness Attributes or qualities of the surveillance system, including: simplicity flexibility data quality acceptability sensitivity predictive value positive representativeness timeliness stability Each of these facets is described in the following pages. Importance of a surveillance system The importance of a health event and the need to have that health event under surveillance can be assessed with one or more of the following measures: total number of cases: incidence, prevalence severity of illness: case-fatality rate, death-to-case ratio mortality: overall and age-specific mortality rates, years of potential life lost morbidity: hospitalisation, disability health care costs potential for spread or potential clinical course in the absence of intervention preventability public interest By considering the \u2018potential for spread\u2019, we recognise the need to maintain surveillance for diseases that currently may be rare or under control, but that could recur. By considering \u2018preventability\u2019, we reflect the intended link between surveillance and public health intervention. Question 1. Incidence vs prevalence 2. Potential for spread - measles 3. Preventability - COVID? Reading the points that discuss disease importance on the previous page raises two questions: Is the importance of a disease always the same? Media, Political, Social Importance not necessarily same as greatest burden (e.g. CVD, respiratory) - importance ABS/AIHW publications can change level of importance How and Why might it change? Mutation of the pathogen: While generally over the long-term pathogens evolve to be less damaging to the host, over the short-term they can mutate to have worse symptoms, be more infectiousness, or evade immunity produced by vaccines or previous infection. When this happens it may increase the importance of the disease. Public attitude: Funding is of course necessary to maintain surveillance programs, and this funding usually comes from the government, which can be influenced by the public opinion towards the necessity of the program. One example is the changing public attitude to the COVID-19 pandemic - while recently both case numbers and deaths in NSW have been increasing, the public have been less supportive of continued measures to control the spread and thus authorities have not re-introduced restrictions or changed plans for closures of testing clinics in the coming months. Improvements in technology: Advancements in treatment may mean that the illness no longer has a serious impact on infected individuals and so is less important in terms of control. Reduction of prevalence or eradication due to vaccination programs may also decrease importance. Changing conditions: Changes in weather and climate may influence disease spread, e.g. an increase in rainfall and/or humidity may increase the prevalence of fungal infections. Furthermore, changes in living conditions can significantly impact disease - improved sanitation, reduction of overcrowding, improvements in insulation etc. can all reduce the incidence of various diseases. Context/people involved - e.g. HFMD in farmers (livestock yield, financial) vs an adult in Sydney Record your answer in the discussion below to these questions, and please comment on your colleagues answers as well. Objectives and Operations The objectives of a surveillance system should be clear to those who maintain and who contribute to the system. It may be helpful to consider first what information is needed for effective prevention and control, then to determine which objectives are most appropriate. Objectives may include any of the uses of surveillance described earlier (see Module 1). For example, one of the objectives of a surveillance system may be to determine the occurrence of a health event or to monitor a program\u2019s progress in eradicating a disease. Using the link below, review the surveillance objectives (sometimes recorded as \u201creasons for surveillance\u201d) in NSW Control Guidelines for some of the notifiable infectious diseases in New South Wales. Contrast, for example, the objectives for measles surveillance with those for chlamydia. http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/controlguideline/Pages/default.aspx (Links to an external site.) What questions might you raise to characterise the operations of a surveillance system? Think about the things that need to be included and read the examples on the next page. What operations do we need? To characterise the operations of a surveillance system, we might consider the following questions: What is the objective of the surveillance system? What are the planned uses of the data from the system? What is the case definition of the health event? Is it practical in this setting? What is the legal authority for the data collection? What is the level of integration with other systems? What are the key components of the system? What is the population under surveillance? What is the time period of data collection (weekly, monthly, annually)? What information is collected? Is it what programs need? What are the reporting sources or data sources? Who is supposed to report? Who actually does report? How is the data handled? How are they routed, transferred, stored? Are there unnecessary delays? How is the data analysed? By whom? How often? How thoroughly? How is the information disseminated? How often are reports distributed? To whom? Does it get to all those who need to know, including the medical and public health communities and policymakers? What measures are in place to ensure patient privacy, data confidentiality and system security? Sometimes it is helpful to sketch a flow chart of a surveillance system to portray the flow of information visually. See the figure below. This can help to understand the flow of information, identify any potential problems with timely reporting, and help to understand who the information is important for from a public health perspective. Resource Requirements The direct costs of a surveillance system include the personnel and financial resources expended to maintain all phases of the system, including collection, analysis, and dissemination. We usually assess these direct costs against the system\u2019s objectives and usefulness, and against the expected costs of possible modifications or alternatives to the system. Indirect costs should also be taken into account \u2013 these are the costs that result from onward changes due to the implementation of a surveillance system \u2013 such as the need for repeat laboratory tests or time off work for a person having a test again. Usefulness Under usefulness, we address whether a surveillance system makes a difference. We may assess usefulness by answering the following: what actions have been taken to date (public health, clinical, legislative, etc.) as a result of information from the surveillance system? who has used the information to make decisions and take actions? what other future uses might the information have? The usefulness of a system is influenced greatly by its operation, including: its feedback mechanism to those who need to know, and by the system\u2019s attributes, described below. In Module 1 we saw an example of how useful measles surveillance had been to prompting large scale interventions and to monitoring the successful impact of those programs. Similarly, surveillance for pertussis has documented major shifts in the most commonly notified age groups over the last decade with subsequent changes to the immunisation schedule in Australia, another example of surveillance very usefully informing the public health response. Program characteristics The qualities or characteristics on the next 2 pages describe the operation and usefulness of a surveillance system. To evaluate a surveillance system we must assess, either qualitatively or quantitatively, each of these. Refer to the CDC Guidelines for evaluating Public Health Surveillance for an extended discussion on each of these attributes. Simplicity Simplicity refers to the structure and ease of operation of the system as a whole and each of its components (case definitions, reporting procedures, etc.). In general, a surveillance system should be as simple as possible while still meeting its objectives. A simple system is more likely to provide timely data with fewer resource needs than a complex system. Simplicity is also closely related to acceptability and affects the resources required to operate the system. Flexibility Flexibility refers to the ability of a surveillance system to accommodate changes in operating conditions or information needs with little additional cost in time, personnel or funds. Usually, flexibility is necessary when changes occur in case definitions, or reporting forms and procedures. Flexibility also includes the system\u2019s ability to add new health events. Acceptability Acceptability reflects the willingness of individuals and organisations to participate in a surveillance system including those who report cases, those who manage the system and those who are responsible for any public health response. We may gauge acceptability of reporting by the proportion that report cases (of those who should report) and by how complete their report forms are. For systems that use interviews with subjects, acceptability may also be measured by interview completion rates. In general, acceptability of reporting is influenced greatly by how much time the reporter must invest. We may also consider acceptability in terms of the intended link with programs. Are the program managers and others responsible for action responsive to the information provided by the surveillance system? Timeliness Timeliness is the availability of data in time for appropriate action. Public health authorities may not be able to initiate prompt intervention or provide timely feedback if delays occur in any aspect of a surveillance system whether in data collection, management, analysis, interpretation, or dissemination. The priority placed on timeliness will depend on the purpose of the system. An outbreak of measles or a new COVID-19 case notification require a rapid response whereas changing trends in coronary heart disease are less time critical and can be disseminated to a population gradually. The use of electronic data transmission and web-based surveillance systems have improved timeliness and data quality. Think back to readings 3 and 4 and the differences electronic systems made with tracking and following up COVID-19 cases in Taiwan and the US. Stability Stability is the reliability and availability of the system, that is, its ability to work as intended when needed. The human resources, hardware and software available to the surveillance system may influence stability. Epidemiological characteristics Data Quality Data quality refers to the completeness and validity of the data. The frequency of missing data provides a ready measure of completeness. Assessing validity requires a comparison with \u2018true\u2019 values from another source such as an audit of notification forms or comparison with other data collections. The sensitivity and predictive value positive of the system will also influence data quality. Data quality needs to be understood to be able to interpret the data and to understand its representativeness. Sensitivity Sensitivity is the ability of a system to detect the cases or other health events it is intended to detect. We may measure sensitivity by conducting a representative survey to establish the true frequency of the health event in the population under surveillance and comparing the results with those from the surveillance system. Sensitivity also refers to the system\u2019s ability to detect epidemics, outbreaks and other changes in disease occurrence. As noted earlier, many surveillance systems detect only a small proportion of the cases that actually occur. The type of surveillance \u2013 active, passive or sentinel may influence this. We must then assess whether a system that is not 100% sensitive in terms of individual cases is nonetheless sufficiently sensitive to identify community-wide problems. Systems that do not have high sensitivity may still provide a useful measure of trends provided the sensitivity remains stable. However, surveillance artefacts may result if sensitivity changes substantially. Increased sensitivity may occur, for example, with the introduction of a new clinical test that picks up cases earlier or with increased public awareness so more people attend and have a test performed. In these situations it may be challenging to distinguish such artefactual increases in surveillance detected cases from a genuine increase in disease in the population. Surveillance for genital chlamydia infection will usually have low sensitivity as many infected people will have no symptoms and will likely not present for testing. Surveillance data still provide useful epidemiological information but if there are changes in these data they need to be considered in the context of any developments that might vary the level of surveillance sensitivity. The introduction of a more sensitive PCR test in the 1990\u2019s, for example, contributed to the significant increase in notifications at that time. It is important to make sure that test sensitivity is not confused with the sensitivity of a surveillance system overall, with the latter potentially affected by all the factors noted above. Predictive Value Positive Predictive value positive is the proportion of reported cases, which truly are cases, or the proportion of reported epidemics, which are actual epidemics. That is, it is a measure of the predictive value of a reported case or epidemic. We measure predictive value positive by investigating whether the reported cases and epidemics meet our definition for a true case or real epidemic. The more \u2018false-positive\u2019 reports there are in a surveillance system, the lower the predictive value of the reports. These result in unnecessary investigations, wasteful allocation of resources, and \u2013 especially for false reports of epidemics \u2013 unwarranted public anxiety. Representativeness Representativeness is the extent to which a surveillance system accurately portrays the incidence of a health event in an entire population by person, place, and time. It includes the quality or accuracy of the data provided and is influenced by the acceptability and sensitivity of the system. For us to generalise or draw conclusions about a community using surveillance data, the system must be representative. In calculating rates from surveillance data, it is important not to assume, without evaluation, that the system is representative. In evaluating the representativeness of a system, we seek to identify important subpopulations systematically excluded or under represented by the system. Consider several examples. Notification rates for genital chlamydia are consistently higher in females than males in New South Wales. Are the levels of chlamydia in the tested population representative of the broader community? We know that this is not the case and that at a community level rates of infection are very similar in males and females. The notification rates are a result of differences in testing. Females visit their general practitioners more frequently, have much higher rates of testing and a higher proportion of their infections are detected. However if subpopulations are looked at within the male population \u2013 there are discrepancies in testing rater. Males that identify as men who have sex with men (MSM) have higher notification rates than those that do not identify as MSM. Thus comparing males and females alone without looking at the subpopulations means you cannot understand how to apply the data to the broader community. During the widespread influenza pandemic in 2009 some small country towns in NSW had very low rates of influenza notified. For many this was not representative of the level of influenza infection in those communities but resulted from reduced access to health care and laboratory testing. COVID-19 has shown us internationally that some countries had \u2018low\u2019 levels of cases \u2013 some reporting none at all despite being surrounded by other countries with high rates of infections. This highlighted access to testing for these areas \u2013 with various reasons such as lack of political belief or will to introduce testing, lack of access due to poor health infrastructure and community suspicion regarding testing and the public health ramifications of a positive test result. Overall We evaluate a surveillance system so that we can draw conclusions about its present state and make recommendations about its future potential. In our conclusions, we should state whether the system addresses an important public health problem, whether it is meeting its objectives, and whether it is operating efficiently. If it is not doing these things, we should recommend modifications in the system, or address the question of whether the system should be continued at all. In making recommendations for modifications, we must recognise that the various attributes and costs are interrelated and potentially conflicting. For example, efforts to improve sensitivity may reduce predictive value positive and timeliness may be adversely affected by efforts to collect a detailed data set. For any surveillance system, some attributes are more important than others. We must consider each attribute and its relative importance to ensure that the system\u2019s objectives will be met.

By considering \u2018preventability\u2019, we reflect the intended link between surveillance and public health intervention. Question 1. Incidence vs prevalence 2. Potential for spread - measles 3. Preventability - COVID? Reading the points that discuss disease importance on the previous page raises two questions: Is the importance of a disease always the same? Media, Political, Social Importance not necessarily same as greatest burden (e.g. CVD, respiratory) - importance ABS/AIHW publications can change level of importance How and Why might it change? Mutation of the pathogen: While generally over the long-term pathogens evolve to be less damaging to the host, over the short-term they can mutate to have worse symptoms, be more infectiousness, or evade immunity produced by vaccines or previous infection. When this happens it may increase the importance of the disease. Public attitude: Funding is of course necessary to maintain surveillance programs, and this funding usually comes from the government, which can be influenced by the public opinion towards the necessity of the program. One example is the changing public attitude to the COVID-19 pandemic - while recently both case numbers and deaths in NSW have been increasing, the public have been less supportive of continued measures to control the spread and thus authorities have not re-introduced restrictions or changed plans for closures of testing clinics in the coming months. Improvements in technology: Advancements in treatment may mean that the illness no longer has a serious impact on infected individuals and so is less important in terms of control. Reduction of prevalence or eradication due to vaccination programs may also decrease importance. Changing conditions: Changes in weather and climate may influence disease spread, e.g. an increase in rainfall and/or humidity may increase the prevalence of fungal infections. Furthermore, changes in living conditions can significantly impact disease - improved sanitation, reduction of overcrowding, improvements in insulation etc. can all reduce the incidence of various diseases.

With the ever-increasing complexity and invasiveness of medical care, the risk of adverse events has increased. A large number of adverse events due to HAIs are known to be preventable (2) and considerable resources are now directed to the surveillance and control of healthcare-associated infection to improve outcomes for patients. The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS), a national hospital accreditation agency, has defined a range of clinical indicators related to HAI* for hospitals to use internally and for benchmarking. The recent events with the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how important it is to understand the presence, transmission and number of infections that occur within the hospital system through appropriate surveillance and prevention techniques. The ability of hospitals to understand what is happening within their walls has been able to be used to understand what is happening within the community, and how their staff are being affected by this. The widespread employment of universal infection control principles outside the hospital to combat COVID-19 has also shown how appropriate use of hygiene can decrease disease spread in the community. *Note that healthcare-associated infection (HAI) is the preferred terminology. The terms nosocomial or hospital acquired infection are used in some of the readings, however as infection can be associated with outpatient care and in some cases it may be unclear exactly when an infection was acquired, healthcare-associated infection is a more appropriate term. History Surveillance of healthcare-associated infection is not a recent development. Understanding the nature of infections, how they are transmitted, and measures that we can take to prevent transmission has occurred for many years. Typically the first demonstration of hand antisepsis in the context of puerperal fever is attributed to Dr Ignaz Semmelweiss, however the work into understanding this condition and the epidiemiology of it had started many years prior to this, as can be read about in the first paper below. Dr Ignaz Semmelweis is remembered for his demonstration that puerperal sepsis could be spread person-to-person, and that hand antisepsis with a chloride of lime solution by clinical staff significantly reduced the incidence of the disease in the institution. Dr Semmelweis practiced in the Vienna Womens Lying in Hospital in the 1840s, and applied surveillance methods in order to prove his case. He first undertook a retrospective investigation of maternal mortality, and then set up a prospective surveillance system to monitor the problem and identify risk factors. He noted that the mortality rates had increased tenfold since the introduction of the new anatomical school of pathology in the 1820s. The autopsy was the main teaching tool. Using ward-specific mortality rates, he noted that the risk of death in the ward used for teaching medical students was four times the mortality in the ward used for teaching midwifery students. After observing the practices of the students and doctors (whereby they proceeded directly from the autopsy room to attend deliveries), Dr Semmelweis postulated that they may be transferring the infection from the cadavers to the women in labour. After an unsuccessful trial of hand-washing he instituted hand antisepsis with a chlorine solution, in order to prevent transmission of the (presumed) infective agent. His prospective surveillance data documented a dramatic fall in the incidence of puerperal sepsis following the introduction of hand antisepsis. Unfortunately, Dr Semmelweis\u2019s astute observations were not appreciated. He was unable to present his data in a concise, convincing report, and he was not diplomatic in his dealings with colleagues. He was ultimately dismissed and his successor did not enforce hand antisepsis and the maternal mortality rates increased. The modern equivalent of his approach, the use of alcohol gel for hand antisepsis, is now used extensively in Australian hospitals. There are some interesting historical readings if you want to find out more about this: Gould, I. M. (2010). Alexander Gordon, puerperal sepsis, and modern theories of infection control\u2014Semmelweis in perspective. The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 10 (4), 275-278. doi:http://dx.doi.org.ezproxy.newcastle.edu.au/10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70304-4 Noakes TJ et al Review Article: Semmelweis and the aetiology of puerperal sepsis 160 years on: an historical review Epidemiol. Infect. (2008), 136, 1\u20139 Challenges Interest in hospital infection has gradually increased along with increasing medical technology generally, snowballing in the latter half of the twentieth century. The development of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections resistant to all available antibiotics in 1960 and the spread of this organism in hospitals provided impetus for the development of strategies for controlling healthcare-associated infection and coordinating the infection control efforts of various diverse groups and departments in hospitals. More recently, an expanded range of Multi-resistant Organisms (MROs) have emerged, including Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species (VRE) and Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase producing bacteria such as ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae. The control of MROs in healthcare remains problematic. The most important control strategy appears to be reducing the use of antibiotics in humans and animals as usage of certain types of agents is associated with selection and spread of resistant clones. Adherence to standard (eg. hand hygiene, use of gloves, mask and gowns as required) and additional infection control precautions by healthcare staff is also paramount. Lastly regular cleaning and maintenance of healthcare residential environments and cleaning/sterilisation of equipment are required to prevent the environment from serving as a source of infection. Key points regarding MROs: Antimicrobial resistance contributes to poor outcomes for patients and threatens to undermine the great advances in treatment of infectious diseases over the past 40 The relationship between antibiotics and resistant organisms is complex, encompassing selection and dissemination of resistance determinants within and between human and bacterial hosts. Antibiotic resistance in the community is emerging as a significant problem worldwide, but Australia has few ways of measuring this at present. Surveillance systems for multi-resistant organisms (MROs) have traditionally been laboratory-based, with percentage resistance amongst laboratory isolates being the most often used summary However, laboratory surveillance alone does not give a measure of the burden of disease from multi-resistant organisms. Active, prospective surveillance is required to measure the incidence of new disease caused by MROs, to detect emerging outbreaks of cross-infection within an institution, and to monitor the success or otherwise of interventions designed to reduce the acquisition of MROs. Standardised MRO screening protocols and definitions for surveillance indicators have been developed for Australia, and many hospitals have adopted Some states have established data aggregating centres for at least some organisms such as MRSA and VRE, but few have expanded this to include other types of MRO. The highest incidence of infection with a multi-resistant organism is with MRSA. Antibiotic usage monitoring and analysis is necessary to improve antibiotic prescribing patterns in Australia, where the overall usage in tertiary referral hospitals is high compared to international benchmarks such as the Scandinavian countries, or The Netherlands. Development of the Infection Control Practitioner and the Infection Prevention & Control Committee Given poor compliance with voluntary reporting of healthcare-associated infection it was recognised that dedicated personnel as part of an organised management system for the control of HAIs were required. The British had used trained nurses as \u2018infection control practitioners\u2019 (ICPs) for some time, whilst the development of such services in the US grew out of infection surveillance systems developed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta for the control of tropical diseases in WWII. It was estimated in the US that one ICP full time equivalent was required for each 250 hospital beds (2). By the mid-1970s, active surveillance for HAI was widespread in the United States. A host of risk factors that predispose patients to infection and cause epidemics were identified and studied. The cost-effectiveness of such programs is still debated by some, but their widespread incorporation into hospital practice throughout the world suggests they are cost-effective. In order to coordinate efforts hospital-wide, the Infection Prevention and Control Committee (IPCC) was created, and is now a feature of most accredited hospitals in Australia. To be effective, the committee must have authority, expert advice, access to recent and accurate data, and members must have a close working relationship with clinical personnel to ensure relevance and appropriateness of activities. The core Infection Prevention and Control Committee usually consists of: Director of Medical Services Director of Nursing Infection Control Practitioner (usually a nurse) Microbiologist or Infectious Diseases Physician Other members may come from the following: Surgeon Physician Operating Theatre Nurse Pharmacist Engineer Sterilising Services Representative Kitchen Representative It is paramount that the committee reports directly to the hospital executive or equivalent, to ensure authority. The committee should ensure the appropriateness of HAI surveillance activities, collate accurate epidemiological data, and ensure appropriate, diplomatic feedback to relevant clinical staff. They should develop and disseminate guidelines for the prevention of HAI and have the authority to monitor and enforce their use. In the event of an epidemic, the committee should ensure that the appropriate investigations, reports and actions are implemented.

With the ever-increasing complexity and invasiveness of medical care, the risk of adverse events has increased. A large number of adverse events due to HAIs are known to be preventable (2) and considerable resources are now directed to the surveillance and control of healthcare-associated infection to improve outcomes for patients. The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS), a national hospital accreditation agency, has defined a range of clinical indicators related to HAI* for hospitals to use internally and for benchmarking. The recent events with the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how important it is to understand the presence, transmission and number of infections that occur within the hospital system through appropriate surveillance and prevention techniques. The ability of hospitals to understand what is happening within their walls has been able to be used to understand what is happening within the community, and how their staff are being affected by this. The widespread employment of universal infection control principles outside the hospital to combat COVID-19 has also shown how appropriate use of hygiene can decrease disease spread in the community. *Note that healthcare-associated infection (HAI) is the preferred terminology. The terms nosocomial or hospital acquired infection are used in some of the readings, however as infection can be associated with outpatient care and in some cases it may be unclear exactly when an infection was acquired, healthcare-associated infection is a more appropriate term.","title":"Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI)"},{"location":"Public%20Health/Public%20Health%20Surveillance/Healthcare%20associated%20infections/#history","text":"Surveillance of healthcare-associated infection is not a recent development. Understanding the nature of infections, how they are transmitted, and measures that we can take to prevent transmission has occurred for many years. Typically the first demonstration of hand antisepsis in the context of puerperal fever is attributed to Dr Ignaz Semmelweiss, however the work into understanding this condition and the epidiemiology of it had started many years prior to this, as can be read about in the first paper below. Dr Ignaz Semmelweis is remembered for his demonstration that puerperal sepsis could be spread person-to-person, and that hand antisepsis with a chloride of lime solution by clinical staff significantly reduced the incidence of the disease in the institution. Dr Semmelweis practiced in the Vienna Womens Lying in Hospital in the 1840s, and applied surveillance methods in order to prove his case. He first undertook a retrospective investigation of maternal mortality, and then set up a prospective surveillance system to monitor the problem and identify risk factors. He noted that the mortality rates had increased tenfold since the introduction of the new anatomical school of pathology in the 1820s. The autopsy was the main teaching tool. Using ward-specific mortality rates, he noted that the risk of death in the ward used for teaching medical students was four times the mortality in the ward used for teaching midwifery students. After observing the practices of the students and doctors (whereby they proceeded directly from the autopsy room to attend deliveries), Dr Semmelweis postulated that they may be transferring the infection from the cadavers to the women in labour. After an unsuccessful trial of hand-washing he instituted hand antisepsis with a chlorine solution, in order to prevent transmission of the (presumed) infective agent. His prospective surveillance data documented a dramatic fall in the incidence of puerperal sepsis following the introduction of hand antisepsis. Unfortunately, Dr Semmelweis\u2019s astute observations were not appreciated. He was unable to present his data in a concise, convincing report, and he was not diplomatic in his dealings with colleagues. He was ultimately dismissed and his successor did not enforce hand antisepsis and the maternal mortality rates increased. The modern equivalent of his approach, the use of alcohol gel for hand antisepsis, is now used extensively in Australian hospitals.

The development of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections resistant to all available antibiotics in 1960 and the spread of this organism in hospitals provided impetus for the development of strategies for controlling healthcare-associated infection and coordinating the infection control efforts of various diverse groups and departments in hospitals. More recently, an expanded range of Multi-resistant Organisms (MROs) have emerged, including Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species (VRE) and Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamase producing bacteria such as ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae. The control of MROs in healthcare remains problematic. The most important control strategy appears to be reducing the use of antibiotics in humans and animals as usage of certain types of agents is associated with selection and spread of resistant clones. Adherence to standard (eg. hand hygiene, use of gloves, mask and gowns as required) and additional infection control precautions by healthcare staff is also paramount. Lastly regular cleaning and maintenance of healthcare residential environments and cleaning/sterilisation of equipment are required to prevent the environment from serving as a source of infection. Key points regarding MROs: Antimicrobial resistance contributes to poor outcomes for patients and threatens to undermine the great advances in treatment of infectious diseases over the past 40 The relationship between antibiotics and resistant organisms is complex, encompassing selection and dissemination of resistance determinants within and between human and bacterial hosts. Antibiotic resistance in the community is emerging as a significant problem worldwide, but Australia has few ways of measuring this at present. Surveillance systems for multi-resistant organisms (MROs) have traditionally been laboratory-based, with percentage resistance amongst laboratory isolates being the most often used summary However, laboratory surveillance alone does not give a measure of the burden of disease from multi-resistant organisms. Active, prospective surveillance is required to measure the incidence of new disease caused by MROs, to detect emerging outbreaks of cross-infection within an institution, and to monitor the success or otherwise of interventions designed to reduce the acquisition of MROs. Standardised MRO screening protocols and definitions for surveillance indicators have been developed for Australia, and many hospitals have adopted Some states have established data aggregating centres for at least some organisms such as MRSA and VRE, but few have expanded this to include other types of MRO. The highest incidence of infection with a multi-resistant organism is with MRSA. Antibiotic usage monitoring and analysis is necessary to improve antibiotic prescribing patterns in Australia, where the overall usage in tertiary referral hospitals is high compared to international benchmarks such as the Scandinavian countries, or The Netherlands.","title":"Challenges"},{"location":"Public%20Health/Public%20Health%20Surveillance/Healthcare%20associated%20infections/#development-of-the-infection-control-practitioner-and-the-infection-prevention-control-committee","text":"Given poor compliance with voluntary reporting of healthcare-associated infection it was recognised that dedicated personnel as part of an organised management system for the control of HAIs were required.

Under reporting, lack of representativeness, lack of timeliness, and inconsistency of case definitions are just four of the limitations of some present notifiable disease surveillance systems in Australia. Under reporting Historically, data collection for most notifiable diseases was based on passive reporting by doctors and other health care providers. This remains an important source of data but laboratories now provide the overwhelming majority of notifiable disease notifications. Studies have shown that, in most jurisdictions, only 5-60% of cases of the reportable diseases overall are ever reported by health care providers (2, 3). The most obvious result of such under reporting is that effective action is delayed and cases occur which might have been prevented by prompt reporting and prompt initiation of control measures. In Module 1 we reviewed reasons that doctors in NSW reported for not notifying notifiable diseases (4). These are very similar to those listed below, as reported by health care workers in the United States many years earlier (5). Lack of knowledge of the reporting requirement: unaware of responsibility to report assumed that someone else (e.g., a laboratory) would report unaware of which diseases must be reported unaware of how or to whom to report Negative attitude toward reporting: time-consuming too much hassle (e.g., unwieldy report form or procedure) lack of incentive lack of feedback distrust of government Misconceptions that result from lack of knowledge or negative attitude: compromises patient-doctor relationship concern that report may result in a breach of confidentiality Disagreement with need to report: judgment that the disease is not that serious belief that no effective public health measures exist perception that health department does not act on the reports It is important that public health agencies recognise these barriers to reporting, since many are within the agencies\u2019 power to address or correct. Some strategies to address the most common problems and to improve reporting are discussed in the next section. Lack of representativeness of reported cases Under reporting is not uniform or random. Two important biases act to distort surveillance data. First, health care providers are more likely to report a case that results in severe illness and hospitalisation than a mild case although a person with mild illness may be more likely to transmit infection to others. This bias results in an inflated estimate of disease severity in measures such as the death-to-case ratio. Second, health care providers are more likely to report cases when the disease is receiving a flurry of publicity than they are at other times. This bias results in an underestimate of the true baseline incidence of disease. Both biases were operating in 1981 during the epidemic of tampon associated Toxic Shock Syndrome. Early reports indicated a death-to-case ratio much higher than the ratio determined by subsequent studies, and reported cases declined more than incident cases after the publicity waned. Similarly, the initial outbreak of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the South Western United States in 1993 had a case fatality rate of approximately 80% among cases detected by the early surveillance system. As more information became available on the clinical spectrum and milder cases were recognised, the overall case fatality rate had fallen to 32% in the year 2000. For the many conditions notified by clinicians and laboratories, representativeness is also potentially affected by access to health care. Population groups with limited health care access (eg those in remote areas or with financial barriers to care) may be under-represented in surveillance data. Lack of timeliness Lack of timeliness can occur at each stage of a surveillance system. The reasons for the delays vary. Some delays are disease dependent. For example, doctors cannot diagnose some diseases until confirmatory laboratory and other tests have been completed. Some delays are caused by the reporting procedure. If the procedure is cumbersome or inefficient, delays in reporting will occur. Delays in analysis are common when the surveillance system is seen as a rote function rather than one that provides information for action. Finally, delays at any stage may culminate in delays in dissemination, with the result that the medical and public health communities do not have the information they need to take prompt action. Inconsistency of case definitions In the past, few states have provided practitioners with case definitions for reporting and there were many inconsistencies between states. To improve consistency and predictive value positive of case reporting in Australia the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) developed standard case definitions in 1994. These have since been reviewed and revised by the Communicable Disease Network of Australia. When a new disease occurs, there can be many iterations of a case definition that occur as the clinical symptoms and epidiemiology of that disease are understood. We have all lived through this with the COVID-19 pandemic, where the initial case definitions did not contain symptoms such as loss of smell, however this was included as more information came to light regarding the symptoms in the population. You can see in the CDNA guidelines for COVID-19 the many versions of the guidelines that have been produced for Public Health Units and Health professionals to use in their diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19.

Improve awareness of practitioners Most importantly, all persons who have a responsibility to report must be aware of this responsibility. The health department should actively publicise the list of reportable diseases and the mechanisms by which to report a case. Simplify reporting Reporting should be as simple and painless as possible for the reporter. Many health departments accept telephone reports. If forms are used, they should be widely available, easy to complete, and ask only relevant information. Electronic transmission of reports, particularly from laboratories, has the potential to simplify and speed up the reporting process. Frequent feedback The role of feedback cannot be overemphasised. Feedback may be written, such as a monthly newsletter, or oral, such as a monthly update at Grand Rounds or other meetings. Ideally, the feedback should be timely, informative, interesting, and relevant to practice. In addition to providing information, feedback about disease patterns and control activities based on surveillance data increases awareness and reinforces the importance of participating in a meaningful public health activity. Widen the net Traditionally, the notifiable disease surveillance system has relied on reporting by doctors. Reporting is almost universally required by both commercial and hospital laboratories. In many jurisdictions laboratories are the most important source of surveillance data. Other health care staff such as infection control personnel and school nurses may be appropriate but under-utilised sources of surveillance reports. Active surveillance Active surveillance shifts the burden for report generation from the health care provider to the health department. Active surveillance has been shown to increase the number and proportion of reported cases. Since health department staff contact health care providers on a regular basis, active surveillance also promotes closer personal ties between the providers and the health department staff.

This cycle begins when diseases occur and are reported by healthcare providers to public health agencies . Importantly, being a public health measure, surveillance is not completed until the data is disseminated back to key stakeholders, including: Health care providers Health care agencies General public Other individuals such as government agencies, exposed individuals, employers, vaccine manufacturers, private voluntary organisations, health committees, etc. Note that in our definition of public health surveillance, only recommendations are made (i.e. data is disseminated) - there is no official role of public health surveillance in the administration of prevention and control programs (however dissemination to key stakeholders would imply such a process follows). Surveillance The definition of surveillance in this instance refers to Dr Alexandder D. Langmuir's definition - the monitoring of disease occurence in populations . To avoid confusion, we thus define two forms of surveillance: Public health surveillance - the monitoring of health events in populations whilst data may be collected on an individual-by-individual basis, the data is analysed at a population level The collected data may still include vital signs, etc. in electronic medical record systems the data interpreted may give epidemiological information about disease prevalence, incidence, etc. This is similar to a large population-level observational study e.g. hospitals notify a registry regarding patients who have neck of femur fractures Medical surveillance - to monitoring of individuals (e.g. to detect early symptoms in disease exposure) this is the role of the healthcare provider and works on a 1:1 to basis between a physician and a patient e.g. physicians observe patients who have been close contacts to other COVID patients Questions Where do data come from physicians reporting data covid self-reporting as an example Which of the following is not an example of public health surveillance? Which of the following is not a a component of Langmuir's cycle of Public Health Surveillance? Data collection from relevant sources (e.g. registries, hospital EMR, etc.) Cleaning of raw collected data Analysis of data Interpretation of analysis results (e.g. trends and recommendations) Dissemination of interpretations from analysis Implementation of recommendations with healthcare service providers Indeed, the WHO definition of malaria surveillance included not only case detection but also the obtaining of blood films, drug treatment, epidemiologic investigation, and follow-up Thus, the boundary of surveillance practice excludes actual research and implementation of delivery program Data examined by measures of time, place, person steady decline of congenital syphilis since early 1990s, consistent pattern of primary and secondary syphilis - resurgence of disease in MSM Reported cases of congenital syphilis among infants aged 1 year and rates of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis among women\u2014United States, 1970\u20132005.

e.g. genical chlamydia may be asymptomatic in a population and not identifed by routine surveillance - however assuming a relatively constant proportion of individuals are asymptomatic, we can gauge disease trends in populations and in response to interventions estimate magnitude of health problem in population at risk To allow for planning of effective disease control and prevention activities (e.g. quarantine) To understand disease epidemiology (including risk factors), clinical spectrum, natural history e.g. highly contageous diseases (e.g. meningococcal infection) with potential public health interventions will need to be identified with high sensitivity e.g. non-communicable diseases (e.g. Creutzfeld-Jakob disease) needs high specificity (i.e. identify only real cases) as there is no public health intervention available understand natural severity of a disease or injury to generate hypotheses about a disease etiology To understand baseline data and allow estimation/validation of the effect of prevention and control measures implemented to evalulate control strategies Monitoring of health events We monitor health events for the following purposes: To detect sudden changes in disease occurrence and distribution LHDs use surveillance data regarding disease occurence (e.g. outbreaks and epidemics) and may investigate and initiate prevention activities e.g. Listeria outbreak in Australia (2012) resulted in identification of similar Listeria genotypes in soft cheese from a single Victorial factory resulting in recall of implicated cheese e.g. COVID-19 surveillance e.g. Anthrax (bioterrorism) surveillance to detect outbreaks or epidemics To follow secular (long-term) trends and patterns of disease Allow identification of any disease trends or patterns in populations they serve This allows us to plan for future resource needs e.g. Malaria incidence trends in USA demonstrated incidence spikes after foreign wars, immigration and international travel e.g. identification of increased HIV incidence allowed tracking of at-risk populations to include homosexual men AND IVDU and their partners e.g. identification that young men and women < 25 years are the target of increasing incidence of genital chlamydia infections results in targeted initiatives towards them to document spread and distribution of a health event To identify changes in agents and host factors Monitoring of agent factors e.g. monitoring antigenic drifts of viruses to direct vaccine production e.g. monitoring antibiotic sensitivity of infective organisms to direct antibiotic guidelines e.g. tracking antigenic spread (COVID-19) across continents to track variant spread patterns e.g. tracking disease vectors (e.g. misquitos) to identify human infection (e.g. ross river virus, zika virus, dengue fever) in a timely manner monitoring of host factors Behavioural risk factor surveillance system - monitors factors such as smoking, alcohol use, obesity, seat-belt use To detect changes in health care practices e.g. identifying increasing procedures occuring in hospitals (e.g. increasing caesarean sections) - allowed the hospital to identify and understand why this was occuring (i.e. hospital audits) e.g. surveillance antibiotic use in hospitals To assess quality of health care To assess safety of drugs, devices, diagnostics or procedures Using surveillance data Implementation of public health action Investigation and control e.g. tracing of an outbreak to a certain source - allows for public health warning, relevant recalls, directed medical surveillance and treatment (e.g. vaccination, prophylaxis), closure of restaurant e.g. tracking the primary contact of disease Planning Identification of when an outbreak may occur or when a population is at high risk allows for appropriate allocation of funding and resources Evaluating prevention and control measures Evaluation of program interventions e.g. By tracking measles cases in the USA, we see a drop in the mid-1960s measles incidence, demonstrating the effect of the National Measles Vaccination Program. this data was subsequently used to introduce a 2-dose vaccination policy in the USA in late 1980s This type of data can be used to inform educational and risk-prevention programs Generating hypotheses and stimulating public health research e.g. 1980 surveillance in USA documented 'toxic shock syndrome' - epidemiologists noticed that these cases occured in menstruating women. Using this association, researchers performed focused case-control studies and demonstrated a strong association between TSS and a particular tampon brand which was withdrawl from market.
